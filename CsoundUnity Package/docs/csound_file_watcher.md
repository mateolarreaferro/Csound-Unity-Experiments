# CsoundFileWatcher

From version 3.0 CsoundUnity can detect the changes made to the *csd* file while modifying it in an external editor. For this to work add **FILEWATCHER_ON** in your project Scripting Define Symbols. **This is an experimental feature**: please report any issue [on Github](https://github.com/rorywalsh/CsoundUnity/issues).
