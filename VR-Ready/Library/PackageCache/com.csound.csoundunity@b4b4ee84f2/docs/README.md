# CsoundUnity


CsoundUnity is a custom Csound package for Unity. It provides Unity users with a means of accessing Csound's core API within their Unity C# scripts. Borrowing from Richard Henninger's Csound6 .Net framework, CsoundUnity provides a Unity bridge to a set of pInvoke signatures that are used to call Csound's native API functions from C# code. The system works on OSX, Windows and Android.
